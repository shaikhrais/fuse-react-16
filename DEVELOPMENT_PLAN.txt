DEVELOPMENT PLAN: STATIC TO DYNAMIC CONTENT MIGRATION

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- Previously everything was static text
- Made everything dynamic 
- Now experiencing errors that cannot be solved with current efforts
- Need safe development practices with proper branching strategy

SAFE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY:

1. REPOSITORY & BRANCH MANAGEMENT
   - Create 'develop' branch from current master
   - Use feature branches for each component migration: feature/dynamic-[component]
   - Implement GitFlow workflow:
     * master: production-ready code
     * develop: integration branch
     * feature/*: individual features
     * hotfix/*: emergency fixes

2. ROLLBACK STRATEGY
   - Tag stable versions before major changes
   - Keep static fallbacks for critical components
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Database migrations with rollback scripts

3. TESTING FRAMEWORK
   - Unit tests for dynamic content components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Performance testing for dynamic vs static comparison

4. GRADUAL MIGRATION APPROACH
   Phase 1: Non-critical components (FAQ, features)
   Phase 2: User-facing content (navigation, messages)
   Phase 3: Core functionality (products, contacts, tasks)
   Phase 4: Authentication and admin features

5. ERROR HANDLING & MONITORING
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Fallback to static content on dynamic errors
   - Real-time monitoring dashboards
   - Automated alerts for critical failures

6. DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
   - Staging environment testing
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Automated rollback triggers
   - Health checks before traffic routing

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Create development branches
2. Identify and document current errors
3. Implement error boundaries
4. Add comprehensive logging
5. Create fallback mechanisms
6. Test each component individually
7. Gradual production rollout
8. Monitor and iterate

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Zero downtime during migration
- Ability to rollback within 5 minutes
- Performance equal to or better than static version
- All errors properly handled with fallbacks
